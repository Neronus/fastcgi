fastcgi
=======

Fastcgi is a [cffi](http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/)-binding
to [libfcgi](http://www.fastcgi.com).

Alpha version, bound to change. Use at your own risk.

Features
--------

 - Fast
 - Based on a widely used library
 - Lowlevel layer for speed
 - Highlevel layer based on [gray-streams](www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw43/CLIM/html/climguide-336.htm]



Installation
------------

Download the library from github, add its path to your
`ql:*local-project-directories*`, enter
`(ql:quickload "fastcgi")` and you are good to go.



Architecture
------------

This library is split into two layers:

1. A low-level binding
   This binding is a very thing layer around the original
   library. There is one-to-one mapping between its functions
   and the functions of the `libfcgi`-library.
   This means that you have to work with POSIX file-descriptors
   directly, etc.
2. A high-level binding
   This binding provides some abstraction of the low-level
   binding.
   It provides access functions to environment-variables,
   you don't have to work with c-structures directly,
   and the file-descriptors are abstracted using
   Gray-Streams. The latter means that you can use
   standard Common Lisp functions like `format` to work
   with the fastcgi streams, if `trivial-gray-streams`
   supports your implementation.
